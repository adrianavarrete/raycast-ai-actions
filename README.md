Make AI actions by selecting text in your Mac apps using your favorite models directly from Raycast, without logging in to their platforms; currently, the extension has integration with OpenAI and Anthropic:

### OpenAI

- GPT-4o mini
- GPT-4o

### Anthropic:

- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus

###

The app is not published in the Raycast official store yet; meanwhile, you can install it locally.

## How to Install Locally?

Clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev` in the project's root folder. After that, the extension will be installed and ready to use. Once you have run this npm command, you can stop the server, which will still be installed.
